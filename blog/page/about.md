Hi, 

My name is Nhan, I am a fullstack developer. 

I help companies and individuals develop high performance, scalable and maintainable applications. 

I use Golang and Nestjs for backend development, and use Angular for frontend development.

This blog is the place I share the things I've learned and created over the years.

You can contact me via email [nhanpublic@gmail.com](mailto:nhanpublic@gmail.com).
